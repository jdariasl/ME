Markov Entropies

This is a MatLab implementation of the set of complexity measures based on Markov chains proposed in the paper. 
Julián D. Arias-Londoño, Juan I. Godino-Llorente, "Entropies from Markov Models as Complexity Measures of Embedded Attractors",
Entropy, vol. 17, no. 6, pp 3595-3620, 2015. which is free available from https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/17/6/3595.

Run Demo.m to see an example of its use on the Rössler attractor.  The expected result can be seen on:
